This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that uses tailwind css and openai's gpt 5 nano. The impetus for this application is to shorten and optimize prompts while maintaining intent and quality in order to make integrating with ai models easier and cheaper.

## Getting Started

1. create `.env` and add your OPENAI_API_KEY.

2. run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
